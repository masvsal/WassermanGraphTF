9606.ENSP00000363804,9606,Homo sapiens,KLF4,"Krueppel-like factor 4; Transcription factor; can act both as activator and as repressor. Binds the 5'-CACCC-3' core sequence. Binds to the promoter region of its own gene and can activate its own transcription. Regulates the expression of key transcription factors during embryonic development. Plays an important role in maintaining embryonic stem cells, and in preventing their differentiation. Required for establishing the barrier function of the skin and for postnatal maturation and maintenance of the ocular surface. Involved in the differentiation of epithelial cells and may also fu [...] "
9606.ENSP00000479618,9606,Homo sapiens,MYC,"Myc proto-oncogene protein; Transcription factor that binds DNA in a non-specific manner, yet also specifically recognizes the core sequence 5'- CAC[GA]TG-3'. Activates the transcription of growth-related genes. Binds to the VEGFA promoter, promoting VEGFA production and subsequent sprouting angiogenesis; Basic helix-loop-helix proteins"
9606.ENSP00000297316,9606,Homo sapiens,SOX17,Transcription factor SOX-17; Acts as transcription regulator that binds target promoter DNA and bends the DNA. Binds to the sequences 5'- AACAAT-'3 or 5'-AACAAAG-3'. Modulates transcriptional regulation via WNT3A. Inhibits Wnt signaling. Promotes degradation of activated CTNNB1. Plays a key role in the regulation of embryonic development. Required for normal looping of the embryonic heart tube. Required for normal development of the definitive gut endoderm. Probable transcriptional activator in the premeiotic germ cells (By similarity); SRY-boxes
9606.ENSP00000323588,9606,Homo sapiens,SOX2,"Transcription factor SOX-2; Transcription factor that forms a trimeric complex with OCT4 on DNA and controls the expression of a number of genes involved in embryonic development such as YES1, FGF4, UTF1 and ZFP206 (By similarity). Critical for early embryogenesis and for embryonic stem cell pluripotency. May function as a switch in neuronal development. Downstream SRRT target that mediates the promotion of neural stem cell self-renewal (By similarity). Keeps neural cells undifferentiated by counteracting the activity of proneural proteins and suppresses neuronal differentiation (By si [...] "
9606.ENSP00000259915,9606,Homo sapiens,POU5F1,"POU domain, class 5, transcription factor 1; Transcription factor that binds to the octamer motif (5'-ATTTGCAT-3'). Forms a trimeric complex with SOX2 on DNA and controls the expression of a number of genes involved in embryonic development such as YES1, FGF4, UTF1 and ZFP206. Critical for early embryogenesis and for embryonic stem cell pluripotency"
9606.ENSP00000398632,9606,Homo sapiens,CD44,"CD44 antigen; Receptor for hyaluronic acid (HA). Mediates cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions through its affinity for HA, and possibly also through its affinity for other ligands such as osteopontin, collagens, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Adhesion with HA plays an important role in cell migration, tumor growth and progression. In cancer cells, may play an important role in invadopodia formation. Also involved in lymphocyte activation, recirculation and homing, and in hematopoiesis. Altered expression or dysfunction causes numerous pathogenic phenotypes. Great protein hete [...] "
