- overlap coefficient is highly biased toward sparesely connected nodes (SCN). SCN will have low neighborhood size, causing them to tend toward higher similarity scores. Take for example a node with 1 relationship which connects to a neighbor which has 100. By the definition of overlap coefficient, the size of the intersecting neighborhood set is 1 and the minimum neighborhood size is 1, so the two nodes are 100% similar.
